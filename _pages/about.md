Hey there, I'm Qingli, a Business PhD student at Singapore Management University's Lee Kong Chian School of Business. I dive deep into quantitative marketing, exploring machine learning and unstructured data analysis (text and images).

Beyond that, I'm fired up about sustainability, public policy, LGBTQA, and gender-related marketing. I see marketing as a force for social justice. Graduating in 2025, I'm on an exciting research journey in the world of Marketing. Thanks for stopping by!
