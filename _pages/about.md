I am a quantitative marketing researcher with a PhD from Singapore Management University (SMU). My work lies at the intersection of machine learning and consumer behavior, where I specialize in analyzing unstructured data like text, images, and audio. I develop novel methods to measure the impact of user-generated content (such as online reviews) and create data-driven tools to help managers make more strategic decisions.
