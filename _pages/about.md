Hello, I'm Qingli. I'm currently a PhD candidate in Business at SMU, specializing in quantitative marketing. My research primarily explores how machine learning—especially techniques for processing unstructured data like text, images, and audio—can deepen our understanding of consumer behavior in digital environments. My projects focus on the applications of AI and machine learning to analyze online word-of-mouth, such as reviews, and the empirical modeling of user-generated content impacts. Additionally, I am passionate about developing innovative metrics and methodological tools that managers can use to enhance decision-making.

I am on the 2024-2025 marketing job market.
