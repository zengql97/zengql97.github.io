This is Qingli's home on the web!

I am an undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University now, majoring in Computer Science. I have been admitted to Singapore Management University's Ph.D. Program in Business (Quantitative Marketing).

Being curious about how people making decisions and enjoying digging into big data, I would like to do research which combines big data, machine learning,social network analysis and natural language processing with marketing.

In addition, I also like empirical modeling and econometrics. For I am not majoring in Business or Economics during undergraduate years, I am studying these now. I will summarize all my note in my blog.
