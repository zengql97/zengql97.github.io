Hello, my name is Qingli Zeng and I am a PhD student in Business at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University. My research interests are diverse, but they all center around the intersection of Quantitative Marketing with various topics. Specifically, I am particularly interested in Machine Learning in Marketing and Unstructured Data Analysis, including Text and Image.

Additionally, I am deeply passionate about exploring topics such as Sustainability, Public Policy, LGBTQA, and Gender-related marketing. I firmly believe that marketing can play a vital role in promoting social justice and equality, and these topics are critical to understanding how businesses can create a more inclusive and equitable world. As a PhD student, I am committed to researching these topics and finding ways to apply my findings to real-world marketing practices.

My expected graduation date is in 2025, and I am enthusiastic about continuing my research journey and contributing to the field of Marketing. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
